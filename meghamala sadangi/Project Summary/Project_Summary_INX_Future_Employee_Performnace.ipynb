    "## Project Description:\n",
    "* INX is a leading data analytics and automation solutions provider with a strong global presence spanning over 15 years. Despite INX's reputation as one of the top 20 best employers for the past five years, recent trends indicate declining employee performance indexes and growing concerns within the top management. Service delivery escalations have increased, and client satisfaction levels have dropped by 8 percentage points.\n",
    "\n",
    "* INX's CEO, Mr. Brain, recognizes these challenges but is hesitant to take punitive actions against underperforming employees due to concerns about their impact on overall employee morale and the company's image as an employer of choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To address these issues and make informed decisions, Mr. Brain has decided to initiate a data science project. This project will analyze the current employee data to uncover the underlying causes of the performance issues and provide actionable insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Objectives:\n",
    "* Identify the root causes of declining employee performance within INX.\n",
    "* Provide clear indicators to distinguish non-performing employees.\n",
    "* Develop strategies and recommendations to address performance issues while minimizing the impact on overall employee morale.\n",
    "* Preserve INX's reputation as a top employer and maintain its ability to attract top talent."

    "In the Sales department, higher salary hikes, high work environment satisfaction, recent promotions, 1-15 years of experience, and less than 12 years at the company contribute to excellent performance.\n",

    "### Human Resource:\n",
    "In HR, higher salary hikes correlate with outstanding performance, while low hikes indicate good performance. High work environment satisfaction is linked to better performance. Recent promotions and 3-5 years at the company or in the current role tend to result in excellent performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Development Department:\n",
    "In the Development department, higher salary hikes align with increased employee performance. Regardless of work environment satisfaction or years since their last promotion, most employees demonstrate excellent performance. Total work experience of 1-12 years is associated with outstanding performance, but over 12 years can lead to lower performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Science:\n",
    "In Data Science, a salary hike of over 21% correlates with excellent performance, while work environment satisfaction affects performance. High satisfaction and shorter tenures in the current role lead to outstanding performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research & Development:\n",
    "In R&D, higher salary hikes link to improved performance. High environment satisfaction leads to excellence. Recent and 13+ years old promotions and less than 22 years of experience are performance indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finance Department:\n",
    "In Finance, higher salary hikes and high work environment satisfaction lead to improved and excellent performance, respectively. Recent promotions and long tenure at the company or in the current role are also associated with excellent performance."
